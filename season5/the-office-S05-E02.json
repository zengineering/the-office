Wuh---"}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "Meredith, that is serious.

Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?"}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "That's crazy.  That's crazy talk!  Meredith!  The Merenator, sleepin' with suppliers!  Hoo-ooh!  Wow!  What time we got? [checks watch] You know what?  That's a good place to end it.  Right there.  This, I think, was a great ethics seminar.  She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about.  Right... what is wrong.  Who's to say?  Really.  In the end.  I mean because it is... unknowable.  But, let's give her a round of applause.  Holly, everybody.  Holly!  Get back to work. [everyone applauds, then leaves] [to Holly] Great job.  I am truly impressed.  That, uh, you really pulled that one out.  Classic.  Classic meeting.  We should celebrate."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Oh..."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line."}, {"speaker": "Micheal", "line": "Nnyeah.  What ya gonna do?"}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?"}, {"speaker": "Meredith", "line": "Liaisons, you mean meet-ups?  I don't know, once a month for six years.  Something like that."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Meredith, why don't you tell Holly... it's not what she thinks.  Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around."}, {"speaker": "Meredith", "line": "Am I in trouble here or something?"}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "No... no, this is just a stupid formality."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "No, it's not a formality.  Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal?  Unrelated to business?"}, {"speaker": "Meredith", "line": "Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper.  There's not a lot of fruit in those looms."}, {"speaker": "Micheal", "line": "Ughh!  For the love of God we're trying to help you... stupid bag."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons?  I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?"}, {"speaker": "Meredith", "line": "Well it's funny.  Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here?  I thought I had immunity?"}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.  I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this."}, {"speaker": "Meredith", "line": "Well... I'm not quitting."}, {"speaker": "Jim", "line": "[starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn.  Four seconds."}, {"speaker": "Dwight", "line": "What are you doing?"}, {"speaker": "Jim", "line": "Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure."}, {"speaker": "Dwight", "line": "Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn?  That's absurd. [Jim smiles and starts the stopwatch] Really? [in a mocking voice] Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody!  He's ti--- [Dwight conceeds and goes back to work, Jim stops the watch]"}, {"speaker": "Jim", "line": "Personal conversation.  Seventeen seconds."}, {"speaker": "Dwight", "line": "There is no way that that was--- [Jim starts the watch]"}, {"speaker": "Jim", "line": "[stops the watch] One second."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Well, well.  Holly... lujah!  It's a miracle, you're at your desk."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "It's Mike-raculous."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Hoo-ooh!  Reaching!  You'll get there.  Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "Sounds good."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Good.  Would you care to bang it out over lunch?"}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "Oh I already bought this..."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Oh no, no, no.  Your food is no good here, my lady.  [sweeps her food into the trash can, misses]  Sorry!  You know what?  Let's go out!  Dunder Mifflin's treat.  Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it?  Ethical."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "So, I've gone over corporate policy."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "What do you think?  What do you think of this place?"}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "Oh, it's very nice."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Istn't it?  Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic.  So you're from Des Moines?"}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "Mmm."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Wow, that sounds so... warm."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "In Summer."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Here too.  You know what my favorite season is?"}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "Maybe we should talk about Meredith first."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way.  Autumn was what I was going to say.  When the leaves change.  It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Wow, terminator, terminator."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "I'm from da future."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Yeah."}, {"speaker": "Jim", "line": "Hey, Andy."}, {"speaker": "Andy", "line": "Yo."}, {"speaker": "Jim", "line": "By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?"}, {"speaker": "Andy", "line": "No, I did not.  Was that any good?"}, {"speaker": "Jim", "line": "Actually not.  It was really so-so."}, {"speaker": "Dwight", "line": "Ok. [Dwight turns around, but Jim holds up the stopwatch, threatening to start it]"}, {"speaker": "Jim", "line": "I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?"}, {"speaker": "Andy", "line": "Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?"}, {"speaker": "Jim", "line": "You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake."}, {"speaker": "Andy", "line": "Really? [Dwight closes his eyes, clutches the paper in his hands] Huh, that's cool."}, {"speaker": "Jim", "line": "Story's kinda bland.  It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor."}, {"speaker": "Andy", "line": "Really?  That doesn't sound right."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.  I mean, what sort of place is that to call home?  And Meredith needs this job.  This is her main source of money."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol.  Those are the rules."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Ok, new idea.  We don't report it at all.  We just punish her."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "We punish her?"}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Mmhmm, tell her she can't have sex for six months."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "I don't think we could enforce that."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "I don't know.  I saw this thing, like a belt with a key."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "A chastity belt."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.  You know what I am talking about.  You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the..."}, {"speaker": "Jim", "line": "He has not stopped working for a second.  At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work.  It's exhausting, being this vigilant.  I'll probably have to go home early today."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "What am I saying?"}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Well... bleh busted.  I don't..."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "It's not a family.  It's a workplace."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "I will be honest with you.  That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault.

Look, to be honest the company is getting a discount at a tough time in our balance sheet and I don't know that the right thing to do for the company is to turn our noses up at that."}, {"speaker": "Holly", "line": "Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it."}, {"speaker": "Kendall", "line": "I thought it was clear with you, Holly.
