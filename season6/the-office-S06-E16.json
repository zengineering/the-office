And then, uh, they would say things like \"Oh, this guy's going to fail this class,\" or, \"What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?\"  And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, \"Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people?  Busted.\" ...  Oh, the reason?  The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and...  I was jealous."
