It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about."}, {"speaker": "Pam", "line": "And the clown?"}, {"speaker": "Jim", "line": "Yeah, I can't... really can't move him."}, {"speaker": "Dwight", "line": "What is my perfect crime?  I break into Tiffany's at midnight.  Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier.  It's priceless.  As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me.  She tells me to stop.  It's her father's business.  She's Tiffany.  I say no.  We make love all night.  In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms.  I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada.  I don't trust her.  Besides, I like the cold.  Thirty years later, I get a postcard.  I have a son and he's the chief of police.  This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero.  She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover.  I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin.  That's where I stashed the chandelier."}]}
