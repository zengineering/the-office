He's trained as a grief counselor."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "No, that can't be right."}, {"speaker": "Toby", "line": "Well, I am trained in grief counseling, but, ahh, I don't think that's what they need right now."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Well, then I guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world, doesn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Hey there."}, {"speaker": "Pam", "line": "Hi."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "So how's your day going?"}, {"speaker": "Pam", "line": "Well, I will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone I've never met."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "That sucks. [laughs] You guys got it much harder up here."}, {"speaker": "Pam", "line": "Closer to the epicenter, I guess."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "[laughs] Cool, all right."}, {"speaker": "Toby", "line": "Well, as you know, Ed Truck passed away. So, I'm here to talk about it if anyone would like to."}, {"speaker": "Kevin", "line": "Not really."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "You're ruining it, already. They should not be given the choice."}, {"speaker": "Ryan", "line": "I did not know Ed Truck. So I will probably spend the day zoning out and planning my weekend. I think Ed would have wanted it that way."}, {"speaker": "Toby", "line": "Is anyone having any trouble eating?"}, {"speaker": "Kevin", "line": "No."}, {"speaker": "Toby", "line": "Concentrating? Is anyone having trouble getting their work done today?"}, {"speaker": "Stanley", "line": "I'm having trouble getting my work done today."}, {"speaker": "Toby", "line": "Well, look, sometimes things crop up later. So, uhh, you should know I'm always available if anyone would like to talk."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Wow. Wow. No. No. You are the most heartless, soulless person I've ever met."}, {"speaker": "Toby", "line": "Michael, I'm sorry..."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "No. No. Shh. Enough. It is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here. Dwight, Ryan, I want you to take the table out. We're gonna go on a five minute break, and when you come back, we're going to start with a clean slate, and, in the interim, I would like you to forget everything that Toby has said, okay?"}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "I don't think I'm overstating it when I say that Toby is a plague on this company. And he is worthless. You give people a chance to shine and they blow it, just like you knew they would. Grief counseling is not about, \"Are you hungry? Would you like a sandwich?\" These people are so far gone, you have to stick a food tube down their throats."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Okay, part of the problem was that Toby talked at you. Now, I am going to talk with you. First off, I want you to be comfortable, because you really can't grieve if you're all tight and buttoned up. So, guys, loosen your ties, just take your jackets off if you want. Ladies, let your hair down. You know what? Even take your shoes off. I wanna get personal and I want you all to really open up. And I want you to know that anything and everything can be said."}, {"speaker": "Angela", "line": "Okay. I don't think Kevin should take his shoes off."}, {"speaker": "Kevin", "line": "My feet do not smell. Angela knows that hyperhidrosis is a medically diagnosed condition."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "I found an exercise in Toby's binder that he managed to miss, that involves screening the part of you that says, \"I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna talk about that. That is too private.\" Here's how it works. I'm going to throw you this ball."}, {"speaker": "Toby", "line": "Yeah, the ball-throwing exercise is in the binder. It's in the section marked, \"Fun Ways To Make Brainstorming Sessions Explode With Excitement and Creativity.\""}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Hey, my cousin Billy, they just had the twins."}, {"speaker": "Pam", "line": "Really?"}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Yeah."}, {"speaker": "Pam", "line": "Wow, I thought that was supposed to be, like, next month."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Yeah, I know. I guess they couldn't wait. I'll bring in a picture if you..."}, {"speaker": "Pam", "line": "Yeah, I'd love to see them. Oh, and tell them I say, \"Congratulations.\""}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Sure."}, {"speaker": "Pam", "line": "I should probably head back in."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Yeah?"}, {"speaker": "Pam", "line": "But, umm, thanks for the break."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "No problem."}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "[in his office playing with a Dunder Mifflin Truck when it drops and the \"head\" of the Truck comes off]"}, {"speaker": "Pam", "line": "Michael once told me that Home Alone is the saddest movie ever. When I asked him why, he said, \"Because the whole family forgets the kid at home. There is nothing funny about that.\""}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "That's... Hold it, hold it, hold it. Start, like, right in there. [Dwight digs hole in ground] Just dig."}, {"speaker": "Dwight", "line": "Ow! God!"}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Okay, give it to me. You don't know what you're doing. All right. [Michael starts digging]"}, {"speaker": "Man", "line": "Hey! Hey! What are you guys doing over there?"}, {"speaker": "Michael", "line": "Nothing. Let's just... all right. [talks to warehouse guys] Guys, do you have a box we could use?"}]}
