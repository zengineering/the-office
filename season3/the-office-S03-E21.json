OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI.

You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go?

I could do that."}, {"speaker": "Angela", "line": "Malls are just awful and humiliating.

I'm going in."}, {"speaker": "Jim", "line": "Go crazy."}, {"speaker": "Kevin", "line": "[in women's bathroom] Oh... my... God."}, {"speaker": "Andy", "line": "I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today."}, {"speaker": "Dwight", "line": "Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building."}, {"speaker": "Andy", "line": "This guy looks like a real deviant."}, {"speaker": "Dwight", "line": "No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him.

I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend."}, {"speaker": "Ryan", "line": "I figured. It's cool.
